The term User refers to a natural person who makes use of the technical tools and resources that EMTRICS S.L. provides for him/her, with the intention of responding to satisfaction surveys. This is therefore a legal agreement between the Client and EMTRICS, SL for the provision of satisfaction surveys and the processing of such data.

      <h2>Purpose and Scope of the Service</h2>
      <p>Keweno is a service used to design and execute satisfaction surveys, also meant to gather information and comments on reviews, and recommendations and complaints from Users of a Client’s products or services. The surveys consist of a series of questions and a method of responses, represented by emoticons. There is also an open field where the user can leave comments or suggestions to the client. In the future, it will be possible to add other forms of questions and answers. The service includes the design and preparation of a set of questions and possible answers, depending on the objectives pursued by the Client. The location (establishment, point of sale, etc.) or support (invoice, leaflet, etc) of interest to the Client is named “Opinion Point” (hereinafter OP), that is, the location where, or support for which, he is interested in using the survey services and information collection provided by Emtrics, SL. . The Client may determine the existence of one or more OPs, and the service will be invoiced based on the number of existing OPs, among other billing concepts. The same OP may be in one location or several customer stands, although in the latter case, the Client will not be able to differentiate the location where the opinions have been made. Each OP is defined by a series of administrative data to identify you (name of the OP, Client, Brief Description, Physical address of the establishment, Contact name, Contact email, etc.) and will have an associated set of questions. In addition, for each OP, EMTRICS S.L. will generate a unique Internet address to access the satisfaction survey and a bidirectional Quick Response code (QR) of that URL. The service also includes i) the processing of the collected information, the grouping and generation of its graphic illustrations, in real-time or periodic reports during the time of the contract, ii) the possibility of comparison over time of the collected information between establishments or facilities (OPs) of the Client , and iii) the reception of messages and comments of the User and its transmission to the Client, as well as the reception of messages from the Client and its transmission to the User. The Client chooses the aspects / questions that he/she wants to ask to the Users at each point of opinion or OP. From that moment on, each time a User uses Keweno, he/she will be invited to answer the questions chosen by the Client. The responses from the Users are collected through Emtrics SL’s platform and are available for the Client to consult. Such consultations may be, among others: i) display of opinions and comments, ii) display of the evolution of the User’s satisfaction in different OPs and iii) comparison of the User’s satisfaction between different OPs belonging to the Client. Additionally, the Client may select the desired frequency for viewing all or part of the collected information, as well as the progress reports or any other report defined by Emtrics, SL.</p>

      <h2>Price of the Service</h2>
      <p>The current price for using the service is available in home page of Keweno: www.keweno.com.
